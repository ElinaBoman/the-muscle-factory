# General 
The Muscle Factory is a website that lets users register for an account, book appointments and provieds information about upcomming events. The user can read about the services provided and the people working at The Muscle Factory. When the user has created and accont he/she can manage their bookings with full CRUD functionallity. This means that the user can: 
* Create a booking
* Rewiew their bookings
* Update and edit bookings
* Delete their bookings

The user will be kept up to date with upcoming events, that are manage by the admin panel. This is to always keep the website updated, and also attract new members with fun and creative events. 

The website is also equipped with a contact form where anyone can contact The Muscle Factory, this will also send a auto-reply to the user, to inform that their message has been sent and is awaiting a reply. 

The website is designed to make the user feel welcome regardless of their workout history. Everyone is welcome to join and form a new healty lifestyle with The Muscle Factory.

The id√© for The Muscle Factory is based on my sisters personal trainer company. This project is only a simple example of what a fitness company website could look like and what features that are necessary. This project will hopefully be the base for my sisters company in the future.

## UX
The main goal for the website is to attract new members and also take care of members bookings. It was important that the website had a clean proffesional front. To make the website more interesting and also be able to show The Muscle Factorys matra a Bootstrap Carousel was placed on the landing page. The carousel shows images of the gym, members and some healty food to immideatly let the user know what the website is all about. The fist slide for example lets the user know that it's The Muscle Factorys misson to help members create a healthier lifestyle, but also how important it's to have a helpful community that supports members all the way.

### Colors and Fonts
To create a clean and proffessinal looking website calm colors were used. The main colors are gray but then there are some color pops to catch the eye of the user. This adds a bit of playfulness to the over all clinic looking front. Since this is a company that focus more on the longterm healt of members with not only gym membership but also massage, rehab and dietist it's more of a clinical gym and therefore the colors are more on the cool side. 

The fonts that are used are mainly clean and thin with dark colors. The headings are bold and thick creating a strong and sturdy look. The main text is balanced nicely with the thiner text creating a easy to read front. 
The font for heading has been borrowed from GoogleFonts, and the main text is set to the font of apple device's. 
* Heading: Bebas Neue, fallback: sans-serif
* Main text: apple-system, fallback: sans-serif
