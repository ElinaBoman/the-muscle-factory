# The Muscle Factory- A Django project, for Code Institute
# General 
The Muscle Factory is a website that lets users register for an account, book appointments and provieds information about upcomming events. The user can read about the services provided and the people working at The Muscle Factory. When the user has created and accont he/she can manage their bookings with full CRUD functionallity. This means that the user can: 
* Create a booking
* Rewiew their bookings
* Update and edit bookings
* Delete their bookings

The user will be kept up to date with upcoming events, that are manage by the admin panel. This is to always keep the website updated, and also attract new members with fun and creative events. 

The website is also equipped with a contact form where anyone can contact The Muscle Factory, this will also send a auto-reply to the user, to inform that their message has been sent and is awaiting a reply. 

The website is designed to make the user feel welcome regardless of their workout history. Everyone is welcome to join and form a new healty lifestyle with The Muscle Factory.

The id√© for The Muscle Factory is based on my sisters personal trainer company. This project is only a simple example of what a fitness company website could look like and what features that are necessary. This project will hopefully be the base for my sisters company in the future.

### Project Goals

The main goals for this project was:

* Create a website using Django Framework 

* Use: Bootstrap, python, javascript, CSS and HTML

* Create a website with full CRUD functionallity

* Creat a appeling frontend suiting a fitness website

* Use a database to store information about users and their appointments

* Set up email functionallity and use auto-reply

## UX
The main goal for the website is to attract new members and also take care of members bookings. It was important that the website had a clean proffesional front. To make the website more interesting and also be able to show The Muscle Factorys matra a Bootstrap Carousel was placed on the landing page. The carousel shows images of the gym, members and some healty food to immideatly let the user know what the website is all about. The fist slide for example lets the user know that it's The Muscle Factorys misson to help members create a healthier lifestyle, but also how important it's to have a helpful community that supports members all the way.

### User Stories
The Mucle Factory project was planned trough user stories. Theese stories were created from a user and site owner perspective. The stories describes what the project should include and would set the over all planing structure.

One importent part of this project was to use a agile development method. This would make the customers perspective very important but since this is not a real project with real customers, user stories were made up by creating potential customers and site owners. 

In agile development iterative and incremental development is a very important part. Each user storie represents a smaller and easier to manage part of the project. This helped a lot with planing the workload. 

As there was not a team bulding this project it might be hard to fully grasp the concept of agile development, since teamwork is a big part of that. Instead of having a team, I choose to create a chatgroup on Slack. Working with the critisim I got from fellow students, this turned out to be a very good idea. I got a lot of feedback that I later on implemented in my project, so big credits to my fiends on Slack. 

A Kanban board was created on GitHub to structure the project development. By taking all my user stories and labeling with their significanse for this project, it was a lot easier to assess each user storie after their relevance.

Not all user stories were finished, but all user stories with the label "MUST HAVE" were completed.

### Colors and Fonts
To create a clean and proffessinal looking website calm colors were used. The main colors are gray but then there are some color pops to catch the eye of the user. This adds a bit of playfulness to the over all clinic looking front. Since this is a company that focus more on the longterm healt of members with not only gym membership but also massage, rehab and dietist it's more of a clinical gym and therefore the colors are more on the cool side. 

![Palette](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/colorpalette.png)


The fonts that are used are mainly clean and thin with dark colors. The headings are bold and thick creating a strong and sturdy look. The main text is balanced nicely with the thiner text creating a easy to read front. 
The font for heading has been borrowed from GoogleFonts, and the main text is set to the font of apple device's. 
* Heading: Bebas Neue, fallback: sans-serif
* Main text: apple-system, fallback: sans-serif

### Wireframes

To plan the design and responsivness of The Muscle Factory a tool called Balsamiq was used. This was in the early stages of the project and the images created dosn't represent the finished product. Balsamiq was used to visualize the project in diffrent wireframes.

See Balsamiq wireframes below:

## Database

To store user information a relational database was used called PostgreSQL. The database is managed trough ElephantSQL. Read more about ElephantSQL in deployment section. 

#### The project contains four apps: User(AllAuth), Blog, Bookings and Contact.

The User model is a part of Django's built-in models. This creates an authentication system and allows users to create accounts and make unique bookings.

The EventBooking model is a part of the bookings app and is for the user to create bookings. This is related to the Django built-in User model. It will create unique bookings for each user.

The ContactForm model is not related to any other model since it is not unique to any user. This model will save messages from users in the database but also send an email to both The Muscle Factory and an auto-reply to the user.

The Event model is for the admin to create events that will render on the landing page. This is to make it easy for the site owner to keep the website updated with relevant events. This is also related to the User model, but is for site owner and his/hers employees. 

![Database Models](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/db-models.png)

## General features

### Header and Navigation
The header and navigation menu are responsive and will change to suit different wireframes. On bigger screens, the menu will display all navigation elements, but on smaller screens, the elements will be contained in a hamburger bar. The navbar also contains a kettlebell logo, same as in the title.
The navbar elements change depending on whether the user is signed in or not. For a user who is not signed in, the navigation elements are Home, About us, Contact us, and Booking. If the user is signed in, there will also be a link to My bookings.

![Smaller nav](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/navbar-smaller.png)
![Nav bar collapsable](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/navbar.png)

### Home
The Home page is the landing page. This page contains a Bootstrap carousel with some pictures of the gym, members, and healthy food. This is to immediately describe the company to any user. The pictures are chosen because they resemble community and health. If the user is signed in, there will be a greeting displayed in the carousel. If a user is not signed in, there will instead be a 'Join us now' button that will take the user to the registration form. This is to have as few steps as possible between entering the website and getting users to sign up. The user does not need to look for the registration form since it's the first button on the landing page.

After the carousel, there is some informative text about the company and also the different memberships available.

The user can then read about upcoming events that are posted by the admin. Here fun and creative events are displayed. Not only describing training events but also social events since The Muscle Factory is all about creating a community with a supportive environment between members and employees. The events are clickable and will render more information about the event.

![Index](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/footer.png)

### Register
The Register/Sign up page collects Username, email address, and password. There is also a link to go directly to sign in, which will render the login form. There is information that describes criteria for selecting a password, making it easier for the user to create an account. The form is a part of Django's built-in allauth templates but has been styled to suit this project.
![Signup](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/signup.png)

### About us
The 'About Us' page briefly describes The Muscle Factory's services and employees. The main reason to have this page was to create a more personal connection to users. For a person who has never been to The Muscle Factory, it might seem scary to go to a new gym. In order to make new users feel more comfortable, the pictures of the employees show friendly faces. The description of services is made to make the user feel more secure and let them know that the services are personalized and unique to each user.
![About](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/aboutus.png)

### Contact us
The Contact Us page provides a form for any user to reach out. The form will be stored in the database where the admin can view them in Django's built-in Admin panel. The form will also send an email to The Muscle Factory's email account, and the user will receive an auto-reply. There is also an alert message informing the user of success or errors with the form. The fields collected are Name, Last name, Phone number, Email, and Message. The user can choose if they want to fill out the whole form. Only Name, Email, and Message are required.
![Database Models](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/contact-form.png)

### Bookings
If a user has not signed in, the Bookings link will instead take the user to the registration form. For a user who is signed in, there will be a form to create a booking. The form fields are Event date, Start time, Event choice. There is also a question if this is the user's first appointment. Lastly, the user can add information if there is anything they would like to add. The form will be saved to the database, where the admin can view bookings and approve appointments in the admin panel.
![Bookings](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/create-booking.png)

### My bookings
My bookings will be available to signed-in users. Here the user can view their bookings. The user can also choose to Edit, Delete, or Add their bookings.
![My bookings](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/)

### Login
If a user is registered, they can log in. This is a part of Django's built-in allauth forms. The user can choose to enter 'Remember me' to make future sign-ins easier. If the user does not have an account yet, there is a link to the registration form. When the user has successfully signed in, there will be an alert message.
![Login](./themusclefactory/docs/readme%20docs/images/features/signin.png)
